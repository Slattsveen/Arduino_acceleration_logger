# Arduino_acceleration_logger
An Arduino based accleration logger, writes to an SD-card or streams to a computer. 

This project is about logging acceleration data, simple as that. The unit can either write to an SD-card, or stream to a connected computer. The Arduino-sketch is timed to approximate 500Hz sampling rate, with a varying error of +/- Xms

This repo contains a shopping list detailing the components of the logger, as well as gerber files for PCB-production and an assembly manual. Feel free to make your own :)

The project is provided "as-is", with no warranties. But if you find any obvious improvements, feel free to post an issue.
